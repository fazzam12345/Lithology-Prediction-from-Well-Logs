## Introduction üåü
This project is a web application built using Streamlit that predicts lithology from well logs. The application uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from TensorFlow to make predictions. The well logs are visualized using Matplotlib, and the results can be downloaded as a CSV file.

## Data Source üìä
The training data used for the pre-trained model comes from the Force-2020-Machine-Learning-competition by bolgebrygg. For more details, you can visit their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bolgebrygg/Force-2020-Machine-Learning-competition).

## Code Explanation üìù

### Importing Libraries
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **TensorFlow**: For loading and using the pre-trained model.
- **Joblib**: For loading the scaler.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

### Lithology Keys
- A dictionary mapping numerical labels to lithology types.

### Streamlit UI
- Instructions, file uploader, and sliders are created using Streamlit.

### Data Processing and Prediction
- The `predict_lithology()` function reads the uploaded CSV file, processes the data, and makes a prediction using the CNN model.

### Main Function
- Orchestrates the entire flow of the application, from UI creation to data processing and visualization.
